        <h1>Technical style points</h1>

  
        <p>Broadly we follow the <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2011/07/housekeeping-announcement">Economist Style Guide.</a></p>
        <p>If there are style differences for separate sections of the site, you will see  a ‘Style differences’ heading under the main content; if not, this style is to be assumed across the whole of GOV.UK.</p>
          <h2>Addressing the user</h2>
          <p>Users benefit from simple, direct language. Address the user as ‘you’ where possible. Content on the site often makes a direct appeal to citizens and businesses to get involved or take action, eg: “You can contact HMRC by phone and email” or “Pay your car tax.”</p>
            <h3>Style differences</h3>
            <p>Mainstream: Don’t use ‘we’, ‘I’, ‘our’, ‘us’.</p>
            <p>Inside government: Use ‘we’ if the ‘we’ is obvious from the context, eg it's clearly a department or the government.</p>
          
          <h2>Using plain English</h2>
          <p>Use plain English &ndash; don't use complicated or long words when easy or short ones will do &ndash; use 'buy' instead of 'purchase', 'about' instead of 'approximately' and 'like' instead of 'such as'.</p>
          <p>Write content as simply as possible so that it is usable and accessible to all citizens, regardless of their language and vocabulary skills.</p>
          <p>Write conversationally &ndash; picture your audience and write as if you were talking to them one-to-one but with the authority of someone who can actively assist.</p>
            <h3>Style differences</h3>
            <p>Please note: use of plain English is mandatory for all sections of the site - all audiences should understand our content; this isn’t ‘dumbing down’, this is opening up government information to all.</p>

          <h2>Jargon</h2>
          <p>Avoid unnecessary jargon, legalistic prose, unexplained abbreviations or acronyms, rarely used Latin terms (inter alia, ad hoc, ibid) etc.</p>
            <h3>Style differences</h2>
